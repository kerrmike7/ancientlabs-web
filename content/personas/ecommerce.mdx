## E-commerce AI fails when data is fragmented across the stack.

Most teams have the tools—Shopify, ad platforms, email, support, WMS, analytics—but the data doesn’t reconcile. That makes AI outputs untrusted and automation fragile.

Ancient Labs helps e-commerce teams unify the core data surface, then ship one AI use case tied to a KPI.

---

## Common pain points

- Customer identity scattered across storefront, email, ads, and support  
- Attribution and performance reporting that changes depending on the source  
- Operations data (inventory, fulfillment, returns) disconnected from analytics  
- AI experiments that can’t be audited, measured, or maintained  

---

## What we do

- Map your stack and data flows (storefront, marketing, support, ops, finance)  
- Assess readiness: quality, definitions, access, ownership, governance  
- Identify 1–2 feasible use cases with measurable upside  
- Optionally implement the foundation: connectors, pipelines, quality checks  

---

## What you get

- A readiness scorecard + gap analysis (clear and practical)  
- A shortlist of use cases ranked by effort vs. impact  
- If implementing: a clean, reliable data layer for one primary surface (e.g. customer + order)  
- Basic monitoring + documentation so the foundation stays healthy  

---

## Typical first use cases

- Support automation with RAG grounded in policies + order context  
- Internal search for ops teams across orders, returns, and incidents  
- Smarter segmentation based on consistent customer + lifecycle signals  
- KPI dashboards that reconcile marketing + revenue + operations
