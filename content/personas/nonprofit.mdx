## Non-profits need results from AI—without enterprise budgets.

Programs, donors, finance, and reporting data often live across tools and spreadsheets. That fragmentation makes reporting slow and makes AI initiatives risky.

Ancient Labs helps mission-driven teams fix the foundations, then ship one AI use case tied to impact or operational lift.

---

## What typically breaks

- Program data split across forms, spreadsheets, and case systems  
- Donor/CRM data that doesn’t reconcile with finance or outcomes  
- Reporting that requires manual cleanup and “storytelling math”  
- Pressure to prove impact with limited technical resources  

---

## What we do

- Map your systems and data flows (programs, CRM, finance, grants)  
- Assess readiness: quality, governance, ownership, access, security  
- Identify 1–2 feasible use cases with clear success metrics  
- Optionally implement the minimum data foundation to support production AI  

---

## What you get

- A clear readiness scorecard (simple, board-friendly)  
- A roadmap that prioritizes small bets with real leverage  
- If implementing: working pipelines + definitions your team can maintain  
- Documentation + handoff so you own the system  

---

## Typical first use cases

- Impact reporting assistant grounded in program + finance data  
- Grant reporting automation with evidence links and audit trails  
- Internal search across policies, program docs, and learnings  
- Intake triage support (structured outputs, measurable outcomes)
