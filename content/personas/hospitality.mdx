## Hospitality teams don’t have an AI problem. They have a data problem.

Guest profiles, bookings, marketing, support, and on-property operations often live in separate systems. That fragmentation makes AI unreliable—and makes even basic reporting harder than it should be.

Ancient Labs helps hospitality teams fix the foundations, then ship one reliable AI use case that improves operations or revenue.

## Where hospitality data breaks

- Guest data split across PMS, CRM, email, POS, and support tools  
- Duplicated profiles and inconsistent identifiers across properties  
- Limited visibility into the full guest journey (pre-stay → on-property → post-stay)  
- Manual reporting for performance, loyalty, and service quality  

---

## What we do

- Map your systems and guest data flows (PMS, CRM, email, web, support, finance)  
- Assess readiness: quality, ownership, governance, access, and security  
- Define a practical foundation plan (what to unify first, and why)  
- Optionally implement the minimum data layer required to support production AI  

---

## What you get

- A clear AI/Data Readiness Scorecard (simple, executive-readable)  
- A prioritized 6–12 month roadmap with 1–2 starter bets  
- If implementing: pipelines + a clean “guest data surface” your team can trust  
- Documentation + handoff so your team owns the system  

---

## Typical first use cases

- Guest support assistant grounded in property and policy knowledge  
- Service recovery triage (routing issues faster with consistent context)  
- Unified guest profile for smarter segmentation and retention  
- Operational reporting that doesn’t depend on spreadsheets and heroics
